# DescramblerAnimation


### Techstack : Html , Css , JS 

In this project i used `GSAP` , `Scrolltrigger` and `JQuery` to achieve this DescramblerAnimation.

- for loading animation i used descrambler to get that random alphabet and some css keyframe animation
- for the landing page i used 3d png and animated all the stuff using keyframes 
- for the explore page i used GSAP and Scrolltrigger to animate the cards animation and for the text hover with custom mouse effect i also did that by GSAP
